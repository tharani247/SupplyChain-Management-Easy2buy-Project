Supply chain is all about responsiveness and customer experience

At the most fundamental level, 
supply chain management (SCM) is management of the flow of goods, 
data, and finances related to a product or service, from the procurement of raw materials
 to the delivery of the product at its final destination.

  So we developed an ecommerce site named easy2buy implemented supply chain management through it 
  
  The whole project is designed using django framework
  
  ## Django Framework
Django is a web application framework written in python language and this framework is based on MVT architechure (Model View Template).Django is a very demanding frame due to its rapid development feature
It will take less time to build a web application after receiving requirements from the client which enables a web application to  write applications without having to bother 
about low level details such as protocols,thread management etc.
